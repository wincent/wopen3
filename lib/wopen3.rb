# Wopen3 is a replacement for Open3.
#
# Unlike Open3, Wopen3 does not throw away the exit code of the executed
# (grandchild) process. Only a child process is spawned and the exit status is
# returned in $? as normal.
#
# Usage example:
#
#   result, errors = '', ''
#   Wopen3.popen3('git', 'log') do |stdin, stdout, stderr|
#     threads = []
#     threads << Thread.new(stdout) do |out|
#       out.each { |line| result << line }
#     end
#     threads << Thread.new(stderr) do |err|
#       err.each { |line| errors << line }
#     end
#     threads.each { |thread| thread.join }
#   end
#   status = $?.exitstatus
#   raise "Non-zero exit status #{status}" if status != 0
#
# As this is such a common usage pattern, a 'system' method is provided as a
# convenience:
#
#   result = Wopen3.system('git', 'log')
#   result.status # => 0
#   result.stderr # => ''
#   result.stdout # => 'commit 491411b3...'
#
